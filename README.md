# DeepLearning
Projects in IT3030 Deep Learning, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Spring 2022

## Backpropagation
First project in IT3030. This project implements the backpropagation algorithm for a dense, deep neural network for multiple target outputs.
The data generator included creates binary images of arrows pointing up, left, right or down.

## Probabilistic AI (project 2)
Second project in IT3030.

## Time series prediction (project 3)
Third project in IT3030.
